title: Viewing Plausible stats elsewhere
---

If you're looking to access your Plausible dashboard, metrics and stats outside of the plausible.io website itself, here are some options:

## Stats API

The Plausible Stats API offers a way to retrieve your stats programmatically. [Learn more here](stats-api.md).

## Embedded dashboard

You can embed your Plausible stats dashboard into any other website using an iFrame. This is useful in case you want to showcase your stats on your own website or if you want to offer Plausible-powered web analytics dashboard (without our branding) directly in your user interface. [Learn more here](embed-dashboard.md).

## WordPress plugin

By using our official WordPress plugin, you can view your Plausible stats dashboard directly in your WordPress dashboard without needing to visit our website. [Learn more here](https://plausible.io/wordpress-analytics-plugin).

## Looker Studio

There is a Plausible connector for [Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio)](https://www.epilocal.com/products/plausible-data-studio-connector/).

## Airbyte connector

[Airbyte connector](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/plausible/): A Plausible API connector for Airbyte, an open-source data integration platform. Built and maintained by [Scott Lee Chua](https://github.com/scottleechua).

## CloudQuery for BigQuery, Power BI, S3, Snowflake and more

[CloudQuery Plausible plugin](https://www.cloudquery.io/docs/plugins/sources/plausible/overview) extracts stats from Plausible and loads them into any supported CloudQuery destination (PostgreSQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, S3...).

## GA Insights

[GA Insights](https://www.ga-insights.com/plausible-slack) allows you to extend Plausible Analytics with automated reporting, monitoring and goal tracking straight in Slack.
